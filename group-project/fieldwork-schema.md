## Planning

### Where we will go
There are a few places within Tokyo that are known for their fashion shopping districts. 
* Harajuku
* 109 Shibuya (in Shibuya)
* Takeshitadori
* Uraharajuku

### What we will do
* Visit 5-6 shops, preferably some that specialise in kawaii fashion
* Observe the number of kawaii fashion shops
* Observe people who are going into these shops in the areas of age, gender, dressing, how many people in the group/in groups or not
* Observe in-shop behaviour
  * Traits such as trying on clothes, how many at a time, how they interact with shop owners
* Interview shop assistants/customers about the kind of people that enter, opinions of the style
  * What are the views on kawaii fashion? Why kawaii fashion? How often? Is it convenient? How long does it take? How much does it cost? what do they feel is kawaii fashion
  * Where on the kawaii fashion spectrum would a shop assistant place their shop?
  * Kawaii fashion phenomena
  * Kawaii fashion market share - no. of shops in a street, value in the fashion industry
  * Ask about a shop's marketing mix/strategy?
  * Observe the mannerisms of the shop assistants
* Look for articles on kawaii fashion/history on kawaii fashion

### Other observations
- とある店員によって: lolita fashion has been watered down to be able to be compatible with the mainstream

### Elaborations

Stores have very active and adaptive marketing activities, and this can be seen through the avenues they selected for these efforts.

The clothes on the mannequins in stores are proactively changed to target more specifically the biggest demographic depending on the time and day

Their usage of SNS for marketing is appropriate to their demographics, since the younger generation uses SNS very heavily. 
- evidence for their market awareness  

Some stores also control separate accounts based on region, allowing them to cater to more localised dressing trends and markets. SNS also tends to promote content based on a user's area, making such content appear on target demographics' feeds more often.

The summation of these is a marketing effort that displays very strong market awareness and promotes a style curated by each store. 

Some stores employ sales tactics that complement their marketing efforts. 
- Clothes promoted on SNS on their models in sets
- Discounts given for buying tops and bottoms together 

#### Outside the kawaii scope  
These are phenomena observable even outside kawaii fashion...

>The question then is, what are the differences between kawaii fashion marketing, and marketing of other fashion?

"Disclaimers"  
- These marketing efforts are probably not unique to Án Mille.
  - a good sample and indication of the marketing techniques in the complex
