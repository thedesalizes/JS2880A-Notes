  - there are no main targets
    - compared to other shops, they set their prices cheaper
    - goal: make customer purchase more than one item, a full set. their prices are set lower because of this.
    - 一つの商品だけではなく、セットで商品を買って貰う
    - ここを目的としている
    - customers spend around 13k to 15k on average. no single item is above 10k
    - customer data and opinions on ec side is gathered and they try to make items that customers really need
    - a store that is easy for anyone to enter
    - uriage ha shuumatsu no hou ga takai ga,shummatsu ni kuru okyaku ha sono omise ni kuru koto wo mokuteki to shite inai
    - 売り上げは週末の方が高いが、週末に来る顧客はこのお店に来ることを目的としていない
    - 平日の方がコアーな顧客が多い
    - repeat rate is 30%
      - hence they make an easy to enter store 
      - 力を入れている
    - luxury items 
  - busy times: none in particular
  - buy one mile clothes: from home to anywhere within one mile - that certain kind of clothes. the underwear is also pajamas
    - market strategy
  - top selling: 
  - trends/seasons: too many trends is not good, customers might leave, because some customers might not care about trends
    
  - トレンドを取り入れすぎると離れて行ってしまう顧客が一定数いるため、ある程度の既存の商品を残している
    - torendo wo tori ire sugiru to hanareteitte shmau kokyaku ga itteisu iru tame, aru teidou no kizon no shouhin wo nokoshiteiru
    - there is a number of customers who will leave if too many trends are introduced. some products with these properties are left 
  - 商品開発はするが大きく変わるとは滅多にない
    - shouhin kaihatsu ha suru ga ookiku kawaru to ha metta ni nai
  
    - many products are developed but rarely are major changes made
  - pricing: lower than other competitors so that customers feel like they can afford to buy a set
