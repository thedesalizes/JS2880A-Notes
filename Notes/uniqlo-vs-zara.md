### Customer Expectation
* uniqlo  
    input: hot contents, quality improvement
    input into basic separates
    output: improved basics
* zara  
    something on the slides

### promises to customers
* uniqlo
  * improve quality every year
  * lead time 6 months
* zara
  * release latest trendy fashion twice a week
  * response time 3 weeks

### customer behaviour
* uniqlo
  * customers visit with idea in mind
  * uniqlo stores are designed with these expectations in mind: fast. 
  * like a warehouse
* zara
  * impulse shopping on a whim
  * customers visit to get inspiration
    * what da hell does "touch fashion basic on the table" mean
  * like a closet

### pricing strategy
very limited "price-point" per item  
based on what consumers expect  
uniqlo: high quality with the lowest cost in the market  
zara: half price of entry level counterparts in department stores  
depends on country as well

### promotion
push or pull marketing?

* uniqlo
  * push
  * usually 2-3%, uniqlo spends 3-4% on marketing costs
  * paper marketing (japanese like)
* zara
  * pull
  * less than 0.5% on marketing cost
  * focuses on acquiring important real estate, interior design
  * new products twice a week
    * a customer base that goes to shop for clothes out of habit
  * relies on word of mouth
  * owners do not like paying marketing companies

clockwork operations
* uniqlo
  * new promotion every friday
* zara
  * new product every monday and friday

consumers acknowledge these cycles, promotion becomes more effective
> Clock-worked operation without fail becomes the best promotion

## operations strategy
> When I see companies, I want to consider what the founder is thinking, why they start the business, from where they're coming from, and where they wants to go. These are important. Ambition affects the companies strategy, and consumers pick up on this, consciously or not.

* uniqlo
  * tadashi yanai
  * good at "learning"
    * MANABI JOEZOO
    * tries to learn as much as possible, even from other industries
  * > (...) tsubusu no ha tenchou
  * i missed the rest of the quote god damn it
* zara
  * amancio ortega
  * listening JOEZOO
    * always listens carefully to the consumer voice
    * every staff in the company tries to do this
    * answers to these voices as fast as possible
  * > You need to have five fingers touching the factory and five touching the customer
    * what the fuck? 

## SPA
SPA: Vertical integrated clothing chain model  
SPA --> Specialty store of Private label Apparel  
Before (20th century):  design warehouses separated from stores. バラバラ, or separated  
After (21st century): design companies integrated into stores. fabric supplier and manufacturer share one management

* uniqlo
  * retailer before, SPA model after
* zara
  * original design and manufacturer, now have their own stores

## Expansion strategy
* uniqlo
  * depth expansion
    * because the basic market in any single country is large
    * have to manufacture in low cost countries
    * refer to their pricing strategy to understand why
* zara
  * width expansion
    * because market for working women is limited
    * proximity countries for production: spain, portugal, morocco(?if i heard correctly)

## logistics strategies
consider these alongside customer expectations
* uniqlo
  * do not be short of inventory
  * balance quality/price
  * success condition: low cost
* zara
  * do not tire customers 
  * short shelf-life
  * success condition: speed

understand the differences between them

## changing THE GAME
<b>apparel business bottleneck</b>  
1 season is 13 weeks  
shelf life for single season is 8 weeks (last 5 weeks, that shit goes on sale)  
\>6 Months of forecast required
slow sellers will have leftover stocks, and this is a problem. hard to control hit rates and leftover quantities. traditionally leftovers have to be sold with a huge discount towards the end of the season

> Fashion business is all about controlling shelf life of seasonal merchandise  

<b>so what have these companies done</b>

* uniqlo
  * continuous price control throughout the season
  * goal: sell out all manufactured quantities
  * refer back to SPA to understand how uniqlo has the ability to do this
    * actual question, does this actually happen in singapore?
* zara
  * control supply with small batches and respond quickly to consumer wants

<b>production process of clothing</b>  
inventory risk starts small along the production process, but gets bigger as the process continues  
takes a long time for one step(yarn to fabric) but each step gets slower further down the process

> The Game Changers take time to prepare raw materials in advance, but assemble finished products on market demand to avoid inventory risk  

<i>what are the inventory risks?</i>  
- items that can't be sold

With these measures, discounts to clear stock for either of these stores is reduced to a lower amount than average --> less losses
